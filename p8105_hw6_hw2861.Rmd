## Problem 2
The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities.

### create Create a city_state variable and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. 
```{r homicides}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./Data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ","),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    status = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest"   ~ "unsolved",
      TRUE ~ "solved")) %>% 
    filter(!city_state %in% c("Tulsa,AL", "Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO"))%>% 
    filter(victim_race == "White"| victim_race == "Black")
```
The binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved is called " status". Some cities have been omitted.
